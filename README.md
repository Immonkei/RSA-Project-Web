# 🔐 RSA Encryption Web App

This project is a web-based RSA encryption tool that allows users to **generate RSA keys**, **encrypt messages**, and **decrypt ciphertexts** using their own private key.

## 🚀 Features

### 🛡️ Encrypt Messages
- Transform plaintext into ciphertext using the RSA encryption algorithm.
- Ensures secure transmission over untrusted channels.

### 🔑 Generate Keys
- Create a pair of RSA public and private keys.
- Keys are used for encryption (public) and decryption (private).

### 🔓 Decrypt Messages
- Use your private key to decode encrypted messages.
- Regain access to the original text securely.

## 🖥️ Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS (Tailwind), JavaScript / React (if used)
- **Backend (Optional):** Python (Flask / FastAPI) or Node.js
- **Encryption Algorithm:** RSA (custom implementation or library-based)

## 📦 Installation
